# Java Collections Framework – 5 Day Learning Plan 🧠💻

This repository contains a beginner-to-advanced learning journey through the **Java Collections Framework**, structured over 5 focused days. It includes concept explanations, real-world examples, interview questions with answers, quizzes, and hands-on coding practice.

---

## 📅 Day-wise Breakdown

### ✅ **Day 1: Introduction to Collections & List Interface**
- What is the Collections Framework?
- Differences between Arrays and Collections
- List interface: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`, `Stack`
- CRUD operations, dynamic sizing
- Practice: Implement custom ArrayList usage
- Interview Qs: List vs Array, Vector vs ArrayList

### ✅ **Day 2: Set Interface & Hashing**
- Set interface: `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`
- Hashing, duplicate detection, ordering
- `hashCode()` and `equals()` in action
- Practice: Frequency counter, duplicates filter
- Interview Qs: How `HashSet` detects duplicates

### ✅ **Day 3: Map Interface – Key-Value Pairs**
- `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap` usage
- `put()`, `get()`, `containsKey()`, `remove()`
- Frequency counters, access logs
- Practice: Fruit stock, student marks map
- Interview Qs: Internal working of `HashMap`

### ✅ **Day 4: Iterators, Comparator, Collections Utility**
- `Iterator` vs `ListIterator`
- `Collections.sort()`, `reverse()`, `shuffle()`, `max()`
- Sorting with `Comparable` and `Comparator`
- Practice: Sort students by marks/name
- Interview Qs: Comparator vs Comparable

### ✅ **Day 5: Queue, PriorityQueue, Deque & Real-World Uses**
- `Queue`, `Deque`, `PriorityQueue`
- Min/Max heaps, task scheduling
- Real-world applications: LRU cache, job queues
- Practice:
  - Print job simulation
  - K-largest elements using heap
  - Palindrome check using `Deque`
- Interview Qs: PriorityQueue internals, use cases
